# Welcome Contributors!

## Communication
- If you would like to contribute, please ask for an issue to be assigned to you.
- If you would like to contribute something that is not represented by an issue, please make an issue and assign yourself.
- Only take multiple issues if they are related and you can solve all of them at the same time with the same pull request.

## Code Contribution Workflow

- Identify an unassigned issue and assign it to avoid duplicated efforts (or request assignment by adding a comment).
- Fork the repo and create a new branch for the issue using the format `username/brief-description-of-feature`.
- Commit fixes locally using descriptive messages, squash smaller commits and push up the branch.
- Create a pull request and indicate the addressed issue (e.g. `Resolves #1`) in the title.
- Code review at this point, someone will work with you on doing a code review.
- Merge finally if all looks good.
